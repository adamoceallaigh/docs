# General best practices

1. Assess each situation in its entirety from all users perspectives: visual, non-visual, keyboard users
2. Break down how the page is going to function in its entirety w/ animations, elements disappearing|appearing to all users aforementioned
2. Utilize aria labels, attributes and role for screen readers. Refer to `a11y` documentation below.
3. Structure your HTML so keyboard users can effortlessly progress through page
4. Be careful about using `display: none` w/ context to non-visual users, use `.sr-*` classes on tags where appropriate. <br>These tags sole purpose are to indicate information about the pages for screen-readers
